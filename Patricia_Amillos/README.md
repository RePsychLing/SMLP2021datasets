# Amillos_SMLP-Data-AXB-
This contains an anonymized data set, an analysis RMD file, and a word document of questions I have for the Advanced Frequentist Stream of SMLP 2021.

There are two csv files: the full_axb.csv is an anonymized data set of participants performing an AXB discrimination task. The full_axb_wordcomp is the performance of the same participants on a word identification task.
The RMD file contains the present analysis I did for the AXB data set, but not the wordcomp data set. It contains a detailed description of the experiment and the data sets.
The Questions for Stats Course document contains the specific questions I have for the course regarding my RMD file. 
The MacDonald et al. (2017) paper is included because I refer to it in a specific question I have about analysis.
