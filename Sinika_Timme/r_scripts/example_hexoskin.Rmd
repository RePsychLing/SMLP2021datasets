# Description 

Project Hexo Skin

The HexoSkin project examines physiological and psychological variables during PE lessons. With the help of smart shirts (HexoSkin) physiological parameters (e.g. breathing_rate; minute_ventilation, acceleration, HR, cadence) were collected during PE lessons. Every ten minutes pupils were asked how they currently feel (affect).

Current data sata

Measurements have been carried out in three schools with a total of 31 subjects so far.  12 participants from Zurich, 11 from Nauen and 8 from Potsdam. Each session has 8 time points of affect, while the physiological parameters were recorded every second. In Zurich, the 11 subjects took part at 4 different sessions. In total there were 6 sessions (see Fig. 1).

# This script

* Graphs of the Affect data 


```{r, include=FALSE}
hexaff_all <- read.csv2("../data/hexaff_all.csv", sep=";", comment.char="#")

hexaff_all %>% group_by(ID, date) %>% summarize(N = n()) #%>% group_by(ID) %>% summarize(N = n()) 
#Subject 1 11.05. is missing
#Subject 2 20.04. no hexoskin data
#Subject 8 13.04. no hexoskin data
# Subject 10 20.04. no hexoskin data
#Subject 12: the same or different children? (20.04. and 11.05.)
# Subject 26: no hexoskin
```

# Psychological responses 
## Affect

```{r, include = F}
affect <- hexaff_all %>% group_by(ID, timepoint, date, school_ID) %>% summarize(N = n(), FS = mean(FS))

sum(is.na(affect$FS))

affect %>% group_by(ID) %>% summarize (N = n())

summary(affect)
#We have 510 affect observations, from which 102 are NAs 
```


### Plotting
```{r, include=FALSE}
affect <- affect %>% mutate(ID = as.factor(ID))
```

Individual Data

```{r, echo = F, warning=F}
ggplot(affect, aes(timepoint, FS, color = date)) + facet_wrap(~ID) +
geom_point() + geom_line()
```


Mean growth pattern across individuals on the different time points
```{r, echo = F, warning=F}
ggplot(affect, aes(timepoint, FS)) + facet_wrap(~date) +
   stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "line") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "pointrange")
```

Mean growth pattern across individuals and time points
```{r, echo = F, warning=F}
ggplot(affect, aes(timepoint, FS)) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "line") 
```


### Data Analaysis

We are interested in the variability of the affective response. 

First describe the overall group pattern and then describe how individual participants differ from that pattern
```{r, echo = F}
m0a <- lmer(FS~ 1 + (1|ID), REML = FALSE, data = affect)

m0b1 <- lmer(FS~ 1 + (1|ID) + (1|date), REML = FALSE, data = affect)

m0b2 <- lmer(FS~ 1 + (1|ID) + (1|school_ID), REML = FALSE, data = affect)

m0b3 <- lmer(FS~ 1 + (1|school_ID/ID), REML = FALSE, data = affect)

m0c <- lmer(FS~ 1 + (1|ID) +  (1|date) + (1|school_ID), REML = FALSE, data = affect) # singular fit 

anova(m0a, m0b1, m0b2, m0b3, m0c)
```
Random Effect structure

* There is no significant variability in  mean affect between schools, χ2(1) = 0.0003, p = 0.99, but between dates  χ2(1) = 6.26, p = 0.01.

```{r, echo = F}
tab_model(m0b1)
```

* There is a mean affect of 1.45 (95% CI: 0.70-2.20) on each date averaged over each child across all timepoints.
* Individuals vary around this grand mean by τ00 = 2.93. The sessions vary around the grand mean by τ00 = 0.20
* Individiuals vary around their own mean by σ2 = 3.43

ICC/Conditional R2: 48% of the variance lies between individuals, while 52% lies within individuals. 

```{r, echo = F}
plot_model(m0b1, type = "re")
```


Questions:

* Which is the right random effect structure?
  + Do I need something like (1|school_ID/ID) to account for the nested data structure?
* Correct interpretation of the coefficient?
* How to calculate ICC for the different levels? 





# Model 1: with time variable 
```{r, echo = F}
library(lmerTest)
m1b.1 <- lmer(FS~ timepoint + (1|ID) + (1|date), REML = FALSE, data = affect) 

m1b.2 <- lmer(FS~ timepoint + (timepoint|ID) + (1|date), REML = FALSE, data = affect) 
anova(m0b1, m1b.1, m1b.2)
```

There is a significant effect of time , but not signficant interindividual variablity in the affect slopes over time of individuals. 


# Physiological responses
## Heart Rate
```{r, echo = F}
HR.0 <- lmer(HR~ 1 + (1|ID) + (1|date), REML = FALSE, data = hexaff_all) 

tab_model(HR.0)
```


# Combining psychological and physiological responses 

*How to deal with the fact that we have sampled physiological responses every second and psychological responses every 10 minutes?*

```{r}
FS.HR <- lmer(FS~ HR + (1|ID) + (1|date), REML = FALSE, data = hexaff_all) 
tab_model(FS.HR)

plot_model(FS.HR, type = "pred")
```

I think I need to aggregate the HR data and take the mean for each timepoint when affect was measured?!

```{r}
hexaff_all_agg <- hexaff_all %>% group_by(ID, timepoint, date) %>% summarize(M_FS = mean(FS, na.rm = TRUE), M_HR = mean(HR, na.rm = TRUE))

FS.HR.agg <- lmer(M_FS~ M_HR + (1|ID) + (1|date), REML = FALSE, data = hexaff_all_agg) 
tab_model(FS.HR.agg)

FS.HR.agg.RS <- lmer(M_FS~ M_HR + (M_HR|ID) + (1|date), REML = FALSE, data = hexaff_all_agg, control = lmerControl(calc.derivs = FALSE)) 
tab_model(FS.HR.agg.RS)

anova(FS.HR.agg, FS.HR.agg.RS)
```
